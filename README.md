# discord-status-changer
hi! i'm not sure quite how to use github so forgive me if i've given credit weirdly, but the json part of this comes from: 
*https://github.com/Oct0-xox/discord-status-changer/tree/main
i've modified the code so instead of creating stepped text, your status is now a countdown :3
## Usage: 
* Edit countdown.py
* Configure it by putting your token, emoji, timezone, and time you want to countdown to at the top of the file 
* i ran the file in task scheduler to keep the status updating when my pc is on - keep in mind that if you run this on a regular ide the infinite loop finishes after one iteration
* as this updates your status every 60 seconds, you should not get rate limited or banned.
